Project 1: Wastewater pumping station electricity consumption forecasting
Professional project with Maiple in collaboration with UK utility company. 
Data Science - Time series forecasting
Language: Python
Dates: 

Abstract 
Feasibility study to assess the ability to use AI models to predict energy consumption for wastewater pumping stations at various locations across the United Kingdom. Data from 129 stations were available with up to 2 years of historical data, the data was sampled at 30 minute intervals between April 2018 and March 2020. Localised rainfall forecasts were used in combination with energy data to increase the accuracy of the forecasts. The models that were explored ranged from traditional methods, machine learning and deep learning techniques. Results were mixed across the different groups of pumping stations, with acceptable results for 90% of the stations. The remaining 10% of stations with lower rainfall correlations were found to exhibit a lack of data quality. 

Project 2: Optical Charater Recognition (OCR) for receipt digitisation 
Final year MSc group project at Data ScienceTech Institute. 
Language: Python
Dates: 

Abstract
Masters end of year group project to create a python library to create an application for an AI receipt digitalisation application. This task used a combination of OCR, Computer Vision and NLP in order to identify and extract the key information on a variety of receipts from restaurants, shops, supermarkets etc. The goal of the project was to identify the establishment address, date and the total amount spent. A semi-automated data processing pipeline was contructed using AWS to build and annotate a dataset X of receipts collected by team members and the project supervisor. The models used for training include YOLOv4 and a custom implementation of the Convolutional Universal Text Information Extractor (CUTIE) model in Pytorch. The results achieved wereâ€¦
