## Project 1 - Wastewater pumping station electricity consumption forecasting and anomaly detection

  ### Overview

  **Project type:** Professional, data science
  
  **Institute:** Maiple
  
  **Collaborators:** UK Utility company
  
  **Dates:** 
  
  **Languages:** Python
  
  **Tools:** AWS, Sagemaker, Sci-kit learn, GluonTS, MxNet

  ### Description
  - Feasbility study to assess ability to use AI models to predict energy consumption of Wastewater pumping stations based on rainfall weather forecasts and exploration of anomaly detection algorithms to identify faults. 
  - 129 stations in various locations across the UK with 2 years of data from April 2018 to March 2020 were used.
  - Stations were placed in 3 groups based on rainfall correlation using the Pearson correlation score. 
  - A DeepAR model implementation from the GluonTS deep learning time series forecasting was used to create a model for each group of stations.
  - The models were trained using Amazon Sagemaker in AWS and hyperparamter tuning was performed to improve model performance. 
  - Acceptable results for 90% of the stations with a correlation score greater than 0.3. The remaining 10% of the stations were not able to be accurately forecasted, data for these stations was generally found to be of poor quality.
